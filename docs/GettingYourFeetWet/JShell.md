# JumpScale Interactive Shell

The best place to get acquainted is in the JumpScale interactive shell, based on IPython.

In order to start the JumpScale interactive shell type `js` at the command line.

Everything after `js` will be evaluated in the JumpScale interactive shell session:

```python
js 'j.clients.sshkey.sshagent_start()'
```
