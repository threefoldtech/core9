# AYS

AYS is a self-healing application management framework for cloud infrastructure and is installed as part of Jumpscale.

It combines functions such as:

- **Package Management** like Ubuntu's `apt-get`
- **Service Management** like Ubuntu's `service`
- **Configuration Management** like [ansible](http://www.ansible.com)
- **Build Tool** like [ant](http://ant.apache.org)
- **Monitoring Tool**


@todo: provide simple examples here that introduce AYS usage

AYS Service Manager (`ays`) is a standalone command line tool that comes with Jumpscale:
```
ays
```

It provides a full featured application/service management toolset for install, configuring and controlling any service based on an [AYS service template](../AYS/Definitions/2-Templates-Recipes-Instances.md). To get full understanding use check the [AYS documentation](../AYS/AYS-introduction.md) type the following at the command line:

```
