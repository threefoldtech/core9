JumpScale is a cloud automation product and a branch from what used to be Pylabs. About 9 years ago Pylabs was the basis of a cloud automation product which was acquired by SUN Microsystems from Q-Layer. In the mean time we are 4 versions further and we have rebranded it to JumpScale.

## About JumpScale9 Core

The core module provides the bare framework into which other modules of JumpScale plug into.

Of these provided tools are, most notably:

* [Config Manager](docs/config/configmanager.md)
  The config manager is a secure way to manage configuration instances. Anything saved to the file system is NACL encrypted and only decrypted on the fly when accessed.

- [Executors](docs/internals/executors.md)
  JumpScale comes with its own executors that abstract working locally or remotely.
  Of these executors:

  * SSH Executor (for remote execution)
  * Local Executor (for local execution)
  * Docker Executor (for executing on dockers)

* [JSLoader](docs/JSLoader/JSLoader.md)
* [Node Manager]()
